  Philly Mesh is a community-owned mesh network in the Grester Philadelphia 
  Area (including Philly’s suburbs, parts of New Jersey, and Delaware). 
  Philly Mesh is devised of volunteers consisting of networking enthusiasts, 
  cypherpunks, programmers, and general tinkerers. We aim to use 
  off-the-shelf hardware and open source-source software to create a robust 
  network for hobbyists, communities, or those in need of network access.

  The heart of the Philly Mesh network is a software package (or networking 
  suite, if you’d like to call it) called cjdns. Cjdns handles routing and 
  addressing through implementing an IPv6 network using public-key cryptog-
  raphy. Essentially cjdns creates a secure, robust logical network with 
  privacy in mind. Cjdns doesn’t care what interface you run it on, and will
  create networks over wireless links, Ethernet, fiber, and even the exist-
  ing Internet, making it incredibly flexible for many types of deployments. 
  We are doing most of our experimentation currently with wireless links 
  over the IEEE 802.11s protocol amendment for wireless mesh networking. 
  802.11s handles ad hoc network creation and is comparable to similar tools
  such as batman-adv and OLSR, primarily used by the Friefunk project. With 
  our software stack, cjdns does the heavy-duty work of secure routing and 
  addressing (logical), while 802.11s facilitates the wireless (physical) 
  mesh.

  Many other localized mesh groups (or “meshlocals”) use a similar setup, 
  and our ultimate goal is interoperability with other groups. While mesh 
  networks are currently physically contained to certain geographic regions, 
  we hope to see the distance between them shorten over time. One group we 
  collaborate with extensively is Toronto Mesh, though there are roughly a 
  dozen other groups we are in regular contact with.

  Within Philadelphia and the surrounding area, we are recruiting as many 
  people as possible to set up nodes they can run perpetually at their resi-
  dence, place of business, or community centers. In these early days of 
  creating a physical network, those who want to join might not be able to 
  find other node operators physically close by. Don’t let this be a 
  deterrent! With cjdns, you can tunnel your mesh traffic over your existing 
  Internet connection and get full access to the network (a wide mesh net-
  work known as Hyperboria) while also cementing a location for other mesh 
  enthusiasts in the greater Philadelphia area to easily connect to. Once 
  two or more people running nodes are physically close enough to connect 
  wirelessly, the Internet tunnel connection can be dropped in favor of 
  wireless links (or added in addition to it, the choice is yours)! While we
  are called Philly Mesh, we don’t discriminate geographically. We have 
  members in the city, the suburbs, and surrounding states. Come say hi!

  We are currently looking at ways to expand the network and make network 
  access easier for an end user. Much of our success has been through dev-
  elopment of mesh nodes based on the Raspberry Pi, and other low-cost 
  single board computers like the Orange Pi. Those interested can check out 
  the prototype-cjdns-pi and mesh-orange projects started by Toronto Mesh. 
  These projects offer mostly turn-key solutions to set up ad hoc mesh nodes 
  simply by running a script.

  There are a lot of things that are being discussed or considered for 
  improving the network. A sample of them are listed below, in no particular
  order.

  * Grow the network, get more people setting up nodes and keeping them set 
    up.
  * Make connecting to the network easier for less-technical enthusiasts.
  * Enhance community outreach!
    + More people representing Philly Mesh at local groups like PLUG, 
      Philly 2600, Security Shell, and Philly Sec.
    + Have ambassadors at local universities like Drexel (Are you a member 
      of the CyberDragons?), Temple (Member of TUSec?), and UPenn (Member of
      Penn for Privacy?). Do you attend or work at one of these schools and 
      have interest in organizing a group there?
    + Have a presence or give a presentation at a local event like BSides 
      Philly, BSides Delaware, FOSSCON, PumpCon, or CryptoParty.
    + Have ambassadors at local hackerspaces. Are you a member or organizer 
      at NextFab, The Hacktory, LocalHost Philly, or Hive76? Getting mesh 
      nodes set up at these places would be huge.
  * Devise a wireless backbone. Do you like playing with powerful wireless 
    radios and creating point-to-point links to buildings around the city? 
    How about worrying about all the fun stuff like signal strength, 
    line-of-sight obstruction, or grounding? Do you have access to a rooftop
    where you can run hardware?
  * Design the next generation of turn-key nodes. Let’s create packaged 
    devices that are as easy to use as plugging in and turning on.
  * Standardize our egress traffic. Cjdns nodes can allow themselves to be 
    exit-points for Internet traffic to exit the mesh network, but it would 
    be ideal to not depend on local ISPs to get those done. Do you know of 
    or have connections to and IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) in the area? 
    Maybe you operate a datacenter in the area and have bandwidth to spare?
  * Experiment with other mesh networking technologies. Maybe you’d like the
    experiment with Hamnet, AltheaMesh, or Libremesh. Not only is it good to 
    approach mesh networking from other perspectives, but research here 
    could help with interoperability down the road.
